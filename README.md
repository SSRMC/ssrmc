# ssrmc
An R Package Complementing the Work of the Social Science Research Methods Center at William &amp; Mary

This is an `R` package that will eventually store datasets from experiments and surveys run at the SSRMC, include cheat sheets on methods and data visualization techniques frequently used by the SSRMC, and any other files associated with our work. See more at our [page](https://ssrmc.wm.edu/).

More to come soon, including a GitHub Organization. Stand by...
